# More interactive: Hack'n'Learn

The format of the Hack'n'Learn is to get together and work on coding/learning in different ways:
- Discuss coding side projects/learning
- Work on side projects
- Help others/get helped
- Introduce/get introduced to Rust
- Pitch talks
- Show and tell

## Setup options

### Zoom

### [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/blog/make-it-live-with-video/)

This is a tool that the Study Jams group in Vienna use. One of their members kindly provides an instance with the following settings:
- Rooms aren't live until an administrator "opens it" up.
- Once everyone leaves the room, it becomes closed again

### [Online Town](https://theonline.town/)

This free tool allows us to have spatialised voice chat, meaning we can walk around in a virtual 2D room and have multiple conversations at once, that we can participate in depending on how close we are to one another. It allows us to break into groups and hold side-conversations!

It (currently) doesn't allow screen-sharing, however.
